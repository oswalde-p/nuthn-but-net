## Task
1. Draw a network diagram which contains:
- LB
- Internal service
- DB
- IP’s / Ranges *

### *
Figure out what private IP ranges you can use
How big each network needs to be (what ips you can use)
Reserved IP’s (what are they)
Useable IP space
How to add that to the diagram
How do you write a network ip address
How do you write a network range

2. Implement that network with docker-compose

## 1. Diagram
