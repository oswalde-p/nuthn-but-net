## Task
1. Draw a network diagram which contains:
- LB
- Internal service
- DB
- IP’s / Ranges
  - Figure out what private IP ranges you can use
  - How big each network needs to be (what ips you can use)
  - Reserved IP’s (what are they)
  - Useable IP space
  - How to add that to the diagram
  - How do you write a network ip address
  - How do you write a network range

2. Implement that network with docker-compose

## 1. Diagram
